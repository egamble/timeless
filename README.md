Timeless
========

Timeless is both a functional and a logic language. Timeless is side effect-free and [non-strict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_programming_language). The syntax and semantics of Timeless are inspired by mathematical notation, by naïve set theory, by functional languages including Haskell, and by Prolog.
