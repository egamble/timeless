Timeless
========

Timeless is a [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming language. Timeless is side effect-free and [non-strict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_programming_language). The syntax and semantics of Timeless are inspired by mathematical notation, by [naïve set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory), by functional languages including Haskell, and by [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming).
