Timeless
========

Timeless is a functional, side effect-free, [non-strict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_programming_language) language. The syntax and semantics of Timeless are inspired by mathematical notation, by naïve set theory, by other functional languages including Haskell, and by Prolog.
